# SECTION 1: MEDICO-LEGAL CASE (MLC) ORIENTATION

## 1.1 Step-by-Step MLC Identification Protocol

### Step 1: Initial Triage Screening (Within 5–10 minutes of arrival)
- Upon patient presentation, integrate GBV screening into routine history-taking
- Ask open-ended, non-leading questions:
  - *"Can you tell me what brought you here today?"*
  - *"Has anyone hurt you physically, sexually, or emotionally?"*
  - *"Do you feel safe at home?"*
- Screen for GBV indicators:
  - Physical injuries inconsistent with stated cause
  - Bruising in defensive areas (forearms, shins, upper arms)
  - Injuries at various stages of healing
  - Genital or rectal trauma
  - Patient appears fearful, anxious, or avoids eye contact
  - Accompanying person speaks for the patient or refuses to leave
- If ANY indicator is present → flag as potential MLC

### Step 2: Detailed History-Taking (10–20 minutes)
- Move to a **private, enclosed room** immediately
- Ensure NO unauthorized persons present (including family, unless patient requests)
- Conduct empathetic, trauma-informed interview:
  - Nature of the incident (physical assault, sexual violence, threats, coercion)
  - Exact timeline (date and time of incident, any delay in seeking care)
  - Perpetrator details (relationship, if voluntarily disclosed — do NOT pressure)
  - Patient's current emotional state and immediate safety concerns
  - Whether patient has bathed, changed clothes, eaten, or used the bathroom since the incident (relevant for forensic evidence)
- **Use open-ended questions only:**
  - ✅ *"Can you tell me more about what happened?"*
  - ✅ *"Where on your body were you hurt?"*
  - ❌ *"Did your husband do this?"* (leading)
  - ❌ *"Were you raped?"* (traumatizing, leading)

### Step 3: Physical Examination & Evidence Collection (20–40 minutes)
- **Obtain informed written consent BEFORE proceeding**
- Examine in a well-lit, private room
- Have a same-gender chaperone present (where possible)
- Conduct systematic head-to-toe examination
- Document ALL findings on standardized body maps
- Collect forensic evidence if within the optimal timeframe:
  - Oral swabs (within 12 hours)
  - Genital/body swabs (within 72 hours, up to 96 hours)
  - Fingernail scrapings (within 48 hours)
  - Retain clothing in paper bags (NOT plastic — prevents degradation)
  - Blood/urine samples if drug-facilitated assault suspected (within 96 hours)

### Step 4: Immediate Medical Interventions
- Stabilize using **ABCDE approach** (Airway, Breathing, Circulation, Disability, Exposure)
- Treat wounds, control bleeding, provide pain relief
- Administer PEP, STI prophylaxis, and Emergency Contraception per protocol (Section 2)
- Refer for imaging (X-ray, CT) if fractures or internal injuries suspected
- Arrange specialist consultation if needed (gynaecology, surgery, psychiatry)

### Step 5: Legal Notification (Within 24 hours)
- **Under the Maldives DVPA (2012), reporting is MANDATORY**
- Notify:
  - Maldives Police Service
  - Family Protection Authority
  - Ministry of Gender, Family and Social Services
- File MLC report with complete documentation
- If initial report is by phone → follow up with **written referral within 24–48 hours**
- Inform the patient BEFORE making the report (except in cases of immediate danger)

### Step 6: Follow-Up & Multidisciplinary Coordination
- Schedule follow-up visits: Day 3, Week 1, Week 2, Month 1, Month 3
- Coordinate with: Social workers, counsellors, legal aid, Family Protection Authority
- Monitor for: Infection, pregnancy, PTSD symptoms, suicidal ideation
- Ensure ongoing safety planning

---

## 2.4 Psychological First Aid — Detailed Protocol

### Step 1: Contact & Engagement
- Introduce yourself by name and role
- *"My name is [Name], I'm a [Nurse/Doctor]. I'm here to help you today."*
- Sit at the same level, maintain gentle eye contact
- Do NOT touch without asking first
- *"Is it okay if I sit here with you?"*

### Step 2: Safety & Comfort
- Ensure the physical space is safe, private, and comfortable
- Offer practical comforts: water, blanket, warm drink
- Ask: *"Is there anything you need right now to feel more comfortable?"*
- Ensure the perpetrator is NOT present or nearby

### Step 3: Stabilization
- If the patient is hyperventilating, crying uncontrollably, or dissociating:
- Guide gentle breathing: *"Let's try breathing together. Breathe in slowly... 1, 2, 3, 4... and out slowly... 1, 2, 3, 4..."*
- Grounding technique: *"Can you tell me 5 things you can see in this room?"*
- Allow silence — DO NOT rush

### Step 4: Information Gathering
- *"Can you tell me what you're most worried about right now?"*
- Assess immediate needs: physical safety, medical care, children's safety, housing
- Do NOT force the patient to recount the traumatic event in detail
- Focus on CURRENT needs, not a detailed incident narrative

### Step 5: Practical Assistance
- Address concrete needs:
  - Phone call to trusted person
  - Safe transportation
  - Childcare arrangements
  - Emergency shelter information
  - Clothing (if forensic evidence retained)

### Step 6: Social Connection
- *"Is there someone you trust — a friend, family member, or colleague — who you would like me to contact?"*
- Help re-establish connections with support network
- Respect the patient's choice if they decline

### Step 7: Psychoeducation
- Normalize stress responses:
  - *"What you're feeling right now — the fear, the confusion, the numbness — these are all NORMAL reactions to what happened to you"*
  - *"Your body and mind are protecting you. These feelings will change over time"*
  - *"Having difficulty remembering details does NOT mean you are making it up — it is a normal trauma response"*
- Provide written information on common reactions and self-care

### Step 8: Service Linkage
- Provide referral information:
  - Ongoing counselling/psychological services
  - Legal aid and advocacy
  - Family Protection Authority
  - Support groups (if available)
  - Hotline numbers
- *"Would it be helpful if I set up an appointment for you?"*
- Schedule follow-up: *"I'd like to see you again in [3 days/1 week]. Is that okay?"*

- Use silence effectively — do not fill pauses
- Nod, maintain appropriate eye contact, use minimal encouragers: *"Mmm," "I see," "Go on"*

**Do NOT say:**
- ❌ *"Why didn't you leave?"*
- ❌ *"What were you wearing?"*
- ❌ *"Are you sure that's what happened?"*
- ❌ *"You should have..."*

### I — INQUIRE
**Principle:** Gently explore the patient's needs and concerns. Ask about their priorities — not yours.

**Dialogue examples:**
- *"What are you most worried about right now?"*
- *"Is there anything that would help you feel safer?"*
- *"Do you have any pain that needs attention?"*
- *"Are you worried about your children or anyone else?"*
- *"What would be most helpful for you right now?"*

### V — VALIDATE
**Principle:** Affirm the patient's experience. Remove self-blame. Acknowledge courage.

**Dialogue examples:**
- *"I believe you."*

- *"Do you feel safe going home today?"*
- *"Is the person who hurt you likely to be there?"*
- *"Do you have a place where you can stay safely tonight?"*
- *"Let's think about a plan in case you feel unsafe..."*

**Safety planning elements:**
1. Where to go in an emergency (safe person, safe location)
2. Essential items to have ready (ID, phone, money, medications, documents)
3. Emergency contacts (police, hotline, trusted person)
4. Signal or code word with a trusted person
5. Safe route to leave

### S — SUPPORT
**Principle:** Connect the patient to services and ongoing support. Empower their choices.

**Dialogue examples:**
- *"Would you like me to connect you with a counsellor?"*
- *"There is legal support available — would you like to know more?"*
- *"You don't have to make all these decisions today. We can take it step by step."*
- *"Here is a card with contact numbers you can call any time."*

1. Maldives Police Service
2. Family Protection Authority
3. Ministry of Gender, Family and Social Services

**ALL suspected child abuse cases — NO exceptions, regardless of patient consent**

### How to Communicate This to the Patient:

**At the START of the consultation, before disclosures:**
> *"Before we begin, I want you to know that everything you share with me is treated with the strictest confidence. I will not share your information with anyone without your permission. However, there are certain situations where the law requires me to report for your safety — specifically if there is a risk of serious harm to you or someone else, or if a child is involved. If this situation arises, I will always let you know before any report is made. Do you have any questions about this?"*

**If mandatory reporting is triggered:**
> *"Based on what you've told me, I have a legal obligation to notify [Police/Family Protection Authority]. I want to be transparent with you about this. I will share only the minimum information necessary, and I will do everything I can to protect your privacy. Would you like to be involved in the reporting process?"*

### Exceptions to Confidentiality:
| Situation | Action Required |
|---|---|
| Immediate threat to patient's life | Report to police immediately |
| Child abuse (any form) | Report to police + Family Protection Authority |
| Patient consents to reporting | Report to relevant authorities |
| Court order | Release only specified information |

# SECTION 5: IGMH GBV ASSESSMENT FORM — BEST PRACTICES

## 5.1 Patient Introduction Section

### What to Capture:
- Full name and National ID
- Date of birth / Age
- Gender (self-identified)
- Address (for follow-up — with consent)
- Contact number (with consent; ask if safe to call/text)
- Emergency contact (a TRUSTED person chosen by the patient)
- Date and time of presentation
- Referral source (self, police, community, health facility)
- Interpreter needed? (Language preference)

- ❌ Questions implying blame: "Why were you there?" "Why didn't you fight?"
- ❌ Detailed questions about the assault during the introduction phase (this comes later)

## 5.2 Patient Social Status Section

### Sensitive Questioning Techniques:
- Frame questions around safety and support, not judgment
- *"Can you tell me about your living situation?"*
- *"Who lives with you at home?"*

- Previous history of GBV (only if voluntarily disclosed)
- Custody/childcare situations
- Immigration/residency status (if applicable)
- Dependents (children, elderly) who may also be at risk

### Cultural Sensitivity Notes (Maldives Context):
- Small community settings may increase fear of exposure — reassure about confidentiality
- Family honour concerns may prevent disclosure — create safe, non-judgmental space
- Religious and cultural factors should be respected without enabling harmful practices
- Male survivors exist — ensure inclusive, non-gendered approach to screening and assessment

## 5.3 General Examination Section

### Head-to-Toe Systematic Examination Protocol:

4. Note whether finding is acute (recent) or healing
5. Record patient's explanation for the finding

### Vital Signs: Record at Time of Examination:
- Blood pressure
- Heart rate
- Respiratory rate
- Temperature
- Oxygen saturation
- Pain score (using numeric or visual analogue scale)
- Glasgow Coma Scale (if neurological concern)

# REGIONAL COMPARISON: ONE-STOP CRISIS CENTRE MODELS

## Malaysia OSCC (est. 1994)
- **Location:** Within A&E departments of MOH hospitals
- **Strengths:** 24/7 access, multidisciplinary (medical + forensic + counselling + legal + police + NGO), MOH 2015 Policy & Guidelines for standardisation
- **Evidence Collection:** Mandatory MLC reporting; PEP within 72 hours; 72-hour guideline for sexual assault evidence (up to 120 hours for sodomy)
- **Challenge:** Urban-centred; rural access gaps; police presence during evidence collection can be difficult
- **Relevance to Maldives:** Highly structured model ideal for atoll hospital adaptation; strong police integration

## Sri Lanka — Mithuru Piyasa / Natpu Nilayam (est. 2006)
- **Location:** Within hospitals nationwide
- **Strengths:** Psychosocial focus, befriending services, community outreach; National Guidelines on Examination (2014, UNFPA); "Two-finger test" explicitly prohibited
- **Services:** Screening, medical care, risk assessment, safety planning, legal referrals
- **Challenge:** Resource constraints in rural/remote areas; more psychosocial than medico-legal
- **Relevance to Maldives:** Cultural compatibility (family-oriented); empathetic model needing forensic strengthening

## Thailand OSCC (est. 2004, expanded 2013)
- **Location:** Over 10,611 centres in healthcare facilities nationwide
- **Strengths:** National scale, survivor-centered, consent-driven, telemedicine for remote areas; integrated into Universal Health Coverage (UHC)
- **Services:** Screening, diagnosis, medical care, psychosocial support, legal advice, referrals
- **Challenge:** Inconsistent GBV data across agencies; DVVPA (2007) criticised for prioritising family reconciliation
- **Relevance to Maldives:** Tech-forward (apps, telemedicine) — ideal for dispersed island geography; privacy focus suits conservative contexts

## Recommended Hybrid Model for Maldives:
Adopt **Malaysia's medico-legal structure** + **Sri Lanka's empathetic psychosocial approach** + **Thailand's technology and remote access solutions** for a comprehensive, island-adapted GBV response framework.
