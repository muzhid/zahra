# Research Findings: MLC Orientation & Clinical Best Practices in Responding to Gender-Based Violence

## Prepared for: IGMH GBV Training Programme
## Target Audience: Healthcare Professionals Across the Maldives
## Date: February 2026

---

## Executive Summary

This document presents comprehensive research findings on Medico-Legal Case (MLC) orientation, clinical considerations, and best practices for healthcare professionals responding to Gender-Based Violence (GBV). The research draws on evidence from the World Health Organization (WHO), regional guidelines from Malaysia, Thailand, and Sri Lanka, and the Maldives' national GBV response framework (updated 2024). One in three women aged 15–49 in the Maldives has experienced some form of physical or sexual violence — making this training a critical public health imperative.

## 1. MLC Orientation (Medico-Legal Case)

### 1.1 Identification: Recognizing GBV as a Legal Entity

Gender-Based Violence, as defined by the WHO, encompasses physical, sexual, psychological, and economic violence — including intimate partner violence (IPV), sexual assault, and domestic abuse. Under the **Maldives Domestic Violence Prevention Act (DVPA) of 2012**, GBV constitutes a criminal offence requiring mandatory notification to the Maldives Police Service and the Family Protection Authority.

#### Recognition Indicators for Healthcare Providers
Healthcare providers must screen for GBV indicators during routine consultations. Key indicators include:

**Physical indicators:**
- Injuries inconsistent with the patient's explanation
- Bruising in defensive locations (forearms, shins)
- Injuries at various stages of healing
- Burns, bite marks, or pattern injuries
- Genital or rectal trauma

**Behavioural indicators:**
- Delayed presentation for medical care
- Reluctance to undress or be examined
- Evasive or inconsistent history
- Accompanying person answers on behalf of patient
- Excessive anxiety, flinching, or hypervigilance

**Regional Context:**
- **Malaysia (OSCC Model, est. 1994):** Mandatory screening at all Emergency & Trauma Departments using standardized questionnaires
- **Thailand (MOPH Protocol):** Over 10,611 One Stop Crisis Centres with routine GBV screening integrated into triage
- **Sri Lanka (National Guidelines, 2014):** Government Medical Officers trained to recognize GBV during medico-legal examinations
- **Maldives (IGMH Family Protection Unit, est. 2004):** The sole state-supported GBV services centre; updated national guidelines released in 2024 with UNFPA support

### 1.2 Documentation: MLC Register

Precise documentation is essential for both clinical continuity and legal proceedings. All GBV cases must be entered into the MLC Register with the following critical fields:

| Field Category | Required Information |
|---|---|
| **Case Identification** | Unique MLC Case Number (e.g., MLC-2026-001), Date & Time of Registration |
| **Patient Demographics** | Name, Age, Gender, National ID, Contact Details (with consent) |
| **Incident Details** | Date/Time of Incident, Date/Time of Presentation, Type of GBV, Location, Perpetrator relationship (if disclosed) |
| **Medical Findings** | Summary of injuries, Examination date/time, Examining clinician's name & signature |
| **Evidence Collected** | List of specimens, Collection date/time, Storage location/conditions |
| **Interventions** | Treatments administered, Referrals made (police, counselling, shelter) |
| **Legal Actions** | Police report number, Notification date/time, Authorities notified |
| **Consent Status** | Consent for examination, evidence collection, reporting, photography |
| **Follow-up** | Scheduled dates, Outcomes |

**Key documentation principles (WHO, 2014):**
- Use the patient's own words — document verbatim using quotation marks
- Record objective clinical findings — avoid interpretive language
- Use standardized body maps for injury documentation
- Maintain duplicate records: one for hospital, one for legal authorities

### 1.3 Forensics: Chain of Custody

The Chain of Custody (CoC) is the documented, unbroken chronological record of evidence handling from collection through court presentation. Any breach renders evidence potentially inadmissible.

#### Step-by-Step Protocol:

1. **Collection** — Collect evidence immediately post-examination (swabs, clothing, biological samples) in the presence of a witness. Use standardized Sexual Assault Evidence Collection Kits (SAEKs).
2. **Labelling** — Label each item with: Patient MLC Number, Item Description, Date/Time of Collection, Collector's Name & Signature. Use tamper-evident seals.
3. **Documentation** — Record all items in the MLC Register and a separate CoC form with transfer chain details.
4. **Storage** — Store biological samples at 2–8°C in a locked forensic locker. Limit access to authorized personnel only.
5. **Transfer** — Hand over to police ONLY with signed receipt from receiving officer. Document: Recipient name/rank, signature, date/time.
6. **Analysis** — Ensure the forensic laboratory maintains CoC during processing (e.g., DNA analysis). Receive results with CoC documentation.
7. **Audit** — Regular review of CoC logs for breaches; report and investigate immediately.

**Evidence Collection Timeframes:**
| Evidence Type | Optimal Window | Maximum Window |
|---|---|---|
| Genital/body swabs (DNA) | Within 24 hours | Up to 72–96 hours |
| Oral swabs | Within 12 hours | Up to 24 hours |
| Clothing/fibres | As soon as possible | No strict limit (air-dry first) |
| Fingernail scrapings | Immediately | Up to 48 hours |
| Blood/urine (drug-facilitated assault) | Within 24 hours | Up to 96 hours |

**Regional Practice:**
- **Malaysia:** Evidence collected in A&E, sealed and handed to police with signed CoC form. 72-hour guideline for sexual assault evidence, extending to 120 hours for sodomy cases.
- **Sri Lanka:** The "two-finger test" is explicitly prohibited. Medico-Legal Examination Form (MLEF) issued by police before examination.
- **Thailand:** Consent-driven evidence collection with telemedicine support for remote facilities.

## 2. Clinical Considerations

### 2.1 Immediate Care: Life-Saving Interventions

The first priority is always the patient's medical stabilization. Clinical assessment follows the standard **ABCDE approach**:
- **A** — Airway (secure and clear)
- **B** — Breathing (assess respiratory status)
- **C** — Circulation (control haemorrhage, IV access)
- **D** — Disability (neurological assessment)
- **E** — Exposure (systematic head-to-toe examination)

### 2.2 Prevention: Post-Exposure Prophylaxis

#### HIV Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP)
- **Timeframe:** Initiate within **72 hours** of exposure (ideally within 24 hours)
- **Regimen (WHO 2021):**
  - **Adults:** Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate (TDF) 300 mg + Emtricitabine (FTC) 200 mg **daily** + Dolutegravir (DTG) 50 mg daily — **for 28 days**
  - **Alternative 3rd drug:** Raltegravir 400 mg twice daily, or Lopinavir/Ritonavir (LPV/r)
  - **Children ≤10 years:** Zidovudine (AZT) + Lamivudine (3TC) + LPV/r
- **Monitoring:** Baseline HIV test → 2-week follow-up (adherence, side effects) → 3-month & 6-month HIV re-testing
- **Key point:** Provide the **full 28-day supply** at the initial visit to improve adherence

#### STI Prophylaxis
Administer empirically — do NOT wait for test results:

| STI | Medication | Dose | Route |
|---|---|---|---|
| Gonorrhea | Ceftriaxone | 250–500 mg single dose | IM |
| Chlamydia | Azithromycin | 1 g single dose | Oral |
| Trichomoniasis | Metronidazole | 2 g single dose | Oral |
| Syphilis (if indicated) | Benzathine Penicillin G | 2.4 million units single dose | IM |
| Hepatitis B (if unvaccinated) | HBV Vaccine ± HBIG | Per schedule | IM |

#### Emergency Contraception
| Method | Drug/Device | Timeframe | Efficacy |
|---|---|---|---|
| Levonorgestrel | 1.5 mg single dose | Within 72 hours | ~85% |
| Ulipristal acetate | 30 mg single dose | Within 120 hours | ~98% |
| Copper IUD | Insertion by trained provider | Within 5 days | >99% |

**Important:** Emergency contraception does NOT protect against STIs. A pregnancy test should be performed before IUD insertion.

### 2.3 Psychological Care: Initial Screening & First Aid

#### Psychological First Aid (PFA) — WHO Protocol:
1. **Contact & Engagement** — Approach compassionately, explain your role
2. **Safety & Comfort** — Ensure immediate physical and emotional safety
3. **Stabilization** — Calm breathing techniques for overwhelmed patients
4. **Information Gathering** — Assess immediate needs (physical, psychological, social)
5. **Practical Assistance** — Address immediate concerns (water, blanket, phone call)
6. **Social Connection** — Help re-establish contact with trusted support persons
7. **Psychoeducation** — Normalize stress reactions: "Your reactions are normal responses to an abnormal situation"
8. **Service Linkage** — Connect to ongoing counselling, mental health services, community support

**Trauma-Informed Principles:**
- Safety, Trustworthiness, Peer Support, Collaboration, Empowerment
- Recognize that trauma affects memory — fragmented recall is NORMAL, not indicative of dishonesty

## 3. Best Practices in Response

### 3.1 The LIVES Framework (WHO)

The LIVES framework is the WHO-recommended approach for first-line support to GBV survivors:

| Letter | Action | Clinical Example |
|---|---|---|
| **L** | **Listen** | "I'm here to listen. Can you tell me what happened in your own words?" Listen without interrupting or judging. |
| **I** | **Inquire** | "What are you most worried about right now?" Assess needs — emotional, physical, social, practical. |
| **V** | **Validate** | "What happened to you is not your fault. You showed courage coming here today." Affirm and believe. |
| **E** | **Enhance Safety** | "Do you feel safe going home? Is there someone you trust?" Develop a safety plan together. |
| **S** | **Support** | "We can connect you with counselling and legal support. Would you like that?" Link to services. |

### 3.2 Informed Consent

Written informed consent must be obtained BEFORE each of the following:

1. **Medical examination** — physical and genital/pelvic examination
2. **Forensic evidence collection** — swabs, specimens, clothing retention
3. **Photography** — documentation of injuries
4. **Information sharing** — with police, courts, or third parties
5. **Treatment** — PEP, STI prophylaxis, emergency contraception
6. **Referral** — to counselling, social services, shelters

**Consent principles:**
- Must be **voluntary** — no pressure from family, providers, or authorities
- Patient can **refuse any part** and **withdraw at any time**
- Refusal does NOT affect access to medical treatment
- Must be explained in a **language the patient understands**
- **Special provisions for minors:** Parent/guardian consent required unless they are the suspected offender

### 3.3 Objective Recording

#### Body Map Documentation Protocol:
1. **Explain** the purpose to the patient and obtain consent
2. **Use standardized anatomical diagrams** (front, back, genital/anogenital)
3. **Mark each injury** with precise details:
   - Location (using anatomical landmarks or clock positions for anogenital)
   - Size (measure in mm/cm)
   - Shape and colour
   - Type (abrasion, bruise, laceration, burn, bite mark, swelling, petechiae)
4. **Photograph** alongside the body map (with consent, scale ruler in frame)
5. **Sign and date** the body map
6. **Document absence** of injury explicitly: "No visible trauma noted on [area]"

#### Direct Quoting vs. Paraphrasing:
| ✅ CORRECT (Direct Quote) | ❌ INCORRECT (Paraphrase) |
|---|---|
| Patient stated: "He hit me with a belt on my back" | Patient reports being beaten by partner |
| Patient stated: "He forced himself on me last night" | Patient alleges sexual assault |
| Patient stated: "I was too scared to scream" | Patient was unable to resist |

**Rule:** Always use the patient's exact words in quotation marks. Avoid clinical interpretation of the patient's account.

## 4. Privacy & Confidentiality

### 4.1 Consultation Environment

**Absolute visual and auditory privacy must be ensured:**
- Conduct ALL GBV consultations in a **private, enclosed room** — not behind curtains
- No unauthorized persons present — this includes family members unless explicitly requested by the patient
- Use a **same-gender chaperone** when possible
- Display "Do Not Disturb — Consultation in Progress" signage
- In resource-limited settings: Use available private spaces; schedule during less busy hours; use white noise or background sound

### 4.2 Information Security

| Aspect | Physical Records | Digital Records |
|---|---|---|
| **Storage** | Locked cabinet, restricted access | Encrypted system, password-protected |
| **Access** | Named staff only, sign-in log | Role-based access control |
| **Transfer** | Sealed envelope, signed receipt | Encrypted transmission |
| **Retention** | Per Maldives Data Protection Act | Per hospital policy + legal requirements |
| **Destruction** | Supervised shredding/incineration | Certified data wiping |

### 4.3 Professional Boundaries: Mandatory Reporting vs. Patient Rights

Under the **Maldives Domestic Violence Prevention Act (2012)**:
- Healthcare providers **MUST report** all suspected/confirmed cases of GBV to:
  - Maldives Police Service
  - Family Protection Authority
  - Ministry of Gender, Family and Social Services
- **ALL suspected child abuse** cases must be reported — no exceptions
- Phone reports must be followed by **written referral within 24–48 hours**

**How to explain confidentiality limits to the patient:**
> "Everything you share with me is confidential. I will not share your information without your permission, except in situations where the law requires me to report — specifically if there is an immediate threat to your life or safety, or if a child is involved. I will always inform you before making any report."
